                          In late 2019, Arturo - a finance veteran with a double masters degree (!!?) - reached out on <a target="_blank" href="www.linkedin.com/in/oyown" class="content-link">Linkedin</a> to redesign Seer.gg - a platform structured like the stock market, where users could trade eSport teams using a platform currency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I’m into gaming, and by extension into (some) eSports, but finance was a big mystery to me. I was unsure about taking the project on, until Arturo allowed me to design the brand identity as well.

                        <p>Rather than make this a massive case study going over everything I did, I’d like to show you the process that led me to designing some of the most unique elements of Seer.gg.</p>

                        <p>Every good design is rooted in user data, and this time it wasn’t any different. The challenge however was that the users couldn’t have been more different than each other.</p>
                        <p>According to Arturo, there was the young eSports fan with low finances but high knowledge,</p>

                        <p>Since they were poles apart, I decided to create a fictional third persona - an overlap of both extreme personas.</p>
                        <p>Arturo agreed that the “middle-persona” could be anyone in the financial industry who’s into games, and might turn out to be the biggest source of traffic.</p>

                        <h3>Game vs. Finance</h3>
                        <p>A week into the project, I built (very) low fidelity wireframes and decided to test it out with Arturo’s team - some of them gamers, some knew more about finance. Perfect.</p>
                        <div class="content-image">
                          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Seer/Wireframe.jpg" alt="">
                          <span class="caption">I mark clickable items red</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>The results were surprising, but looking back it should have been expected:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>The gamers didn’t like/see/interact with the financial graphs and charts</li>
                          <li>The people into finance loved the data and wanted more of it</li>
                          <li>Arturo himself wanted more control over the data, such as seeing the trend of his past investments</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It was clear that none of the personas would like to be shown all the data we had available. Financial data would be too complex for an average gamer, gaming data would be too distracting for an investor.</p>
                        <p>The solution was abstraction.</p>
                        <div class="content-image">

                        <blockquote>Taking a leaf out of my (long past) developer days, I separated the users into three categories, slowly “lifting” the abstraction on financial elements the higher you went.</blockquote>
                        <p>To take it a step further, and playing along with the illusion of gaming, I decided to design and name these separations as “levels” - the idea being it’d feel like difficulty settings in an actual game.</p>

                        <p>Confession: I don’t like Jacob’s law, and gaming is one of the few areas where you can get away with breaking it.</p>
                        <p>The design would mainly revolve around data interspersed with highlighted text - that would possibly involve numbers - so, I wanted the colors and typography to be <span class="white-highlight">legible, have high contrast and demand attention when necessary.</span></p>

                        <p>With roots in both finance and gaming, Seer.gg would need to stand out when placed beside age-old financial logos as well as against the flashy eSport ones. For this it needed something different, something dynamic.</p>
                        <p>Something that’d make people do a double-take.</p>

                        <p>I went through several blogs and resources figuring out everything from how they were created to how they were perceived by the user a.k.a which portions of the graph should I highlight more than the others, so I can convey the most information possible with just a glance.</p>

                          <li>A user would choose from a list of currently live games</li>

                          Ideally, the live stream should be the highlight of the page, as it is in the older version. However, a user is here to primarily trade - a live stream is of lower priority than showing the state of the current “market”.
                        </p>
                        <p>So I moved the odds banner up top, and put in links so a person could trade as soon as they land on the page. To make sure they are still able to see the odds while trading - sometimes decisions are made in split seconds - I put the form in a popup at the bottom of the screen.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>For the live stream I moved it beside the Live Chat - a more traditional experience for anyone who’s into watching them. It also makes things easier if a user wants to chat and watch the gameplay at the same time.</p>

                        <p>The trading screen is very complex in itself, but users expect a trading screen to be complex: my priority was to make sure that the most important things were highlighted to the user, and it was clear what to do at every step of the way.</p>
                        <p>Squeezing this all in mobile however, was a different ballgame.</p>

                        <h3>Mobile website + app</h3>
                        <p>Due to restrictions in the US jurisdiction, Seer.gg could not have an app in any of the app stores. So we decided to have an app-like experience within the mobile browser.</p>
                        <p>Easier said than done.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, mobile browsers do not offer as much flexibility as a native app would - they are limited by development in and of itself. Secondly, there’s elements of the browser itself (called “chrome” incidentally).</p>
                        <p>This was an exceptional circumstance, and required an exceptional solution.</p>
                        <div class="content-image">

                        <p>Apps would never have scrolling tables, they’d have smaller rows. Similarly, charts & graphs would resize too to adapt to smaller screens.</p>

                        <p>Complex pages such as the obvious trading page were optimised for the smaller screens. To make sure the user was able to see the odds at all times, I put in a little box which showed the score and tapping that would bring up the trading form.</p>
