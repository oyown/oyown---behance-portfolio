                          In late 2019, Arturo - a finance veteran with a double masters degree (!!?) - reached out on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oyown" class="content-link">Linkedin</a> to redesign <span class="white-highlight">Seer.gg</span> - a platform structured like the stock market, where users could <span class="white-highlight">trade eSport teams</span> using a platform currency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I’m into gaming, and by extension into (some) eSports, but finance was a big mystery to me. I was unsure about taking the project on, until Arturo allowed me to design the brand identity as well.

                        <p>Rather than make this a massive case study going over everything I did, I’d like to show you the process that led me to designing some of the most unique elements of Seer.gg.</p>

                        <p>Every good design is rooted in user data, and this time it wasn’t any different. The challenge however was that the users couldn’t have been more different than each other.</p>
                        <p>There were predominantly 2 types of users:</p>
                        <p>1) The young eSports fan with <span class="white-highlight">low finances but high eSports knowledge.</span></p>

                        <p>A week into the project, I built (very) low fidelity wireframes and decided to <span class="white-highlight">test it out with Arturo’s team</span> - some of them gamers, some knew more about finance. Perfect.</p>

                          <li>People into games <span class="white-highlight">didn’t interact with the financial graphs</span> and charts</li>

                        <p>To take it a step further, and playing along with the illusion of gaming, I decided to design and name these separations as “levels” - the idea being it’d feel like difficulty settings in an actual game.</p>

                        <p>The trading screen was the most complex piece of the platform. To give you an idea, here's a typical flow:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>A user would choose from a list of currently live games</li>
                          <li>They would be taken to a live stream of the game (courtesy of Twitch)</li>
                          <li>A section shows the odds of either team winning</li>
                          <li>They would be able to trade themselves or chat with other users who are in the same lobby</li>
                          <li>They’d also be able to assess the market condition by looking at charts and graphs generated by the transactions of other players (“the market”)</li>

                          In most cases, a live stream should be the highlight. But in case of Seer.gg, the <span class="white-highlight">user is there to  trade</span> - it makes more sense to highlight the state of the current “market”.
                        </p>
                        <p>So I moved the odds banner up top, and put in links so a person could trade as soon as they land on the page. To make sure they are still able to see the odds while trading - sometimes decisions are made in split seconds - I put the form in a<span class="white-highlight"> popup at the bottom of the screen.</span></p>

                        <p>I put the Live Stream and chat together - a more traditional experience. The chat featured both: <span class="white-highlight">a live broadcast and personal chat with anyone who's online.</span></p>

                        <p>The trading screen is very complex in itself, but users <span class="white-highlight">expect</span> a trading screen to be complex: my priority was to make sure that the most important things were highlighted to the user, and it was clear what to do at every step of the way.</p>
                        <p>Squeezing this all in mobile however, was a different ballgame.</p>
