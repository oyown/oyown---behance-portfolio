        <p>
          In late 2019, Arturo - a finance veteran with a double masters degree (!!?) - reached out on <a
            target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oyown" class="content-link">Linkedin</a> to redesign <span
            class="white-highlight">Seer.gg</span> - a platform structured like the stock market, where users could
          <span class="white-highlight">trade eSport teams</span> using a platform currency.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m into gaming, and by extension into (some) eSports, but finance was a big mystery to me. I was unsure about
          taking the project on, until Arturo allowed me to design the brand identity as well.
        </p>
      </section>

      <div class="content-divider"></div>

      <section class="content-width">
        <p>Rather than make this a massive case study going over everything I did, I’d like to show you the process that
          led me to designing some of the most unique elements of Seer.gg.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>Data dilemma</h3>
        <p>Every good design is rooted in user data, and this time it wasn’t any different. The challenge however was
          that the users couldn’t have been more different than each other.</p>
        <p>There were predominantly 2 types of users:</p>
        <p>1) The young eSports fan with <span class="white-highlight">low finances but high eSports knowledge.</span>
        </p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Seer/beginner.png" alt="">
          <span class="caption">Young fan, perhaps a student with side income.</span>
        </div>
        <p>2) The person who knows <span class="white-highlight">everything finance but little about eSports.</span></p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Seer/pro.png" alt="">
          <span class="caption">Financial veteran, like a CFO.</span>
        </div>
        <p>Since they were poles apart, I decided to create a <span class="white-highlight is-italic"> fictional</span>
          third persona - an overlap of both extreme personas.</p>
        <p>Arturo agreed that the “middle-persona” could be anyone in the financial industry who’s into games, and might
          turn out to be the biggest source of traffic.</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Seer/seasoned.png" alt="">
          <span class="caption">A balanced set of attributes</span>
        </div>
        <blockquote> My thinking was this: if I could design for this person, I could easily stretch the boundaries to
          include the other two.</blockquote>
      </section>

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>Gamifying finance</h3>
        <p>A week into the project, I built (very) low fidelity wireframes and decided to <span
            class="white-highlight">test it out with Arturo’s team</span> - some of them gamers, some knew more about
          finance. Perfect.</p>
        <ul class="lightslider">
          <li class="slide-item" data-thumb="../Works/Images/Seer/Wireframe Sketch.jpg">
            <div class="content-image">
              <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Seer/Wireframe Sketch.jpg" alt="">
              <span class="caption">Plans to create wireframe →</span>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="slide-item" data-thumb="../Works/Images/Seer/Wireframe.png">
            <div class="content-image">
              <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Seer/Wireframe.png" alt="">
              <span class="caption">I marked clickable items red</span>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The results were surprising, but looking back it should have been expected:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gamers <span class="white-highlight">didn’t interact with the financial graphs</span> and
            charts</li>
          <li>Investors loved them <span class="white-highlight">and wanted more</span></li>
          <li>Arturo himself wanted more control over the data, such as seeing the trend of his past investments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It was clear that dumping every bit of imformation we have on a person would 1) be unnecessary and 2) make it
          more complex</p>
        <blockquote>The solution was abstraction.</blockquote>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Seer/Tribe - design.png" alt="">
          <span class="caption">Choose difficulty level.</span>
        </div>
        <p>Taking a leaf out of my (long past) developer days, I separated the users into three categories,<span
            class="white-highlight"> slowly “lifting” the abstraction on financial elements</span> the higher you went.
        </p>
        <p>To take it a step further, and playing along with the illusion of gaming, I decided to design and name these
          separations as “levels” - the idea being it’d feel like difficulty settings in an actual game.</p>

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>Breaking laws</h3>
        <p>Gaming is one of the few remaining areas where it's still okay to break <span class="is-italic">Jacob's
            Law</span>, and I wasn't going to give that up. </p>
        <p>A design with complex data and numericals meant I needed colors and typography to be <span
            class="white-highlight">legible, have high contrast and demand attention when necessary.</span></p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Seer/Color + font.png" alt="">
          <span class="caption">I just need an excuse to use Graphik.</span>
        </div>
        <p>With roots in both finance and gaming, Seer.gg would need to stand out when placed beside age-old financial
          logos as well as against the flashy eSport ones. For this it needed something different, something dynamic.
        </p>
        <p> <span class="white-highlight">Something that’d make people do a double-take.</span></p>

          <span class="caption">Making of: Seer & GG</span>
        </div>
        <p>Seems weird to talk about building the identity after talking about the website - but it was easier (and I’d
          argue better) to build an identity now that I knew more about the users I was trying to design for.</p>

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>Data overload</h3>
        <p>Platforms concerned with finance will always be chock full of data, and Seer.gg was no different.</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Seer/Tables & Data.png" alt="">

        </div> -->
        <p>The graphs however weren’t anything like I had ever seen before.</p>
        <p> These weren’t the regular bar or pie charts, these were complicated charts that showed the state of the
          overall market <span class="white-highlight"> relative to the team you are trying to invest in</span> -
          sometimes broken down into time segments.</p>
        <p>I went through several blogs and resources figuring out everything from how they were created to how they
          were perceived by the user. My idea was to figure out how best to highlight the graphs, so I can <span
            class="white-highlight">convey the most information possible with just a glance.</span></p>

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>Live play</h3>
        <p>The trading screen was the most complex piece of the platform. To give you an idea, here's a typical flow:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A user would choose from a list of currently live games</li>
          <li>They would be taken to a live stream of the game (courtesy of Twitch)</li>
          <li>A section shows the odds of either team winning</li>
          <li>They would be able to trade themselves or chat with other users who are in the same lobby</li>
          <li>They’d also be able to assess the market condition by looking at charts and graphs generated by the
            transactions of other players (“the market”)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="lightslider">
          <li class="slide-item" data-thumb="../Works/Images/Seer/Old Design.png">
            <div class="content-image">
              <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Seer/Old Design.png" alt="">
              <span class="caption">Slide over to see the better version → →</caption>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="slide-item" data-thumb="../Works/Images/Seer/New Design.png">
            <div class="content-image">
              <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Seer/New Design.png" alt="">
              <span class="caption">More highlight on what's important</caption>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In most cases, a live stream should be the highlight. But in case of Seer.gg, the <span
            class="white-highlight">user is there to trade</span> - it makes more sense to highlight the state of the
          current “market”.
        </p>
        <p>So I moved the odds banner up top, and put in links so a person could trade as soon as they land on the page.
          To make sure they are still able to see the odds while trading - sometimes decisions are made in split seconds
          - I put the form in a<span class="white-highlight"> popup at the bottom of the screen.</span></p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Seer/Trade popup.png" alt="">
          <span class="caption">Appears when needed</span>
        </div>
        <p>I put the Live Stream and chat together - a more traditional experience. The chat featured both: <span
            class="white-highlight">a live broadcast and personal chat with anyone who's online.</span></p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Seer/Chats.png" alt="">
          <span class="caption">A live chat with personal messaging</span>
        </div>
        <p>The trading screen is very complex in itself, but users <span class="white-highlight">expect</span> a trading
          screen to be complex: my priority was to make sure that the most important things were highlighted to the
          user, and it was clear what to do at every step of the way.</p>
        <p>Squeezing this all in mobile however, was a different ballgame.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>An app that's not an app</h3>
        <blockquote>Due to restrictions in the US jurisdiction, Seer.gg could not have an app in any of the app stores.
          So we decided to have an app-like experience within the mobile browser.</blockquote>
        <p>Easier said than done.</p>
        <p>Firstly, mobile browsers do not offer as much flexibility as a native app would - 1) they are limited by
          development and 2) browser elements hamper the experience</p>
        <p>This was an exceptional circumstance, and required an exceptional solution.</p>

          <span class="caption">For all screen</span>
        </div>
        <p>To make sure there's no scope for horizontal scroll, I made the tables more vertical. However, to show better
          data I let the charts & graphs scroll sideways.</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Seer/Mobile Graphs.png" alt="">
          <span class="caption">Resized graphs and tables</span>
        </div>
        <p>Complex pages such as the obvious trading page were optimised for the smaller screens. To make sure the user
          was able to see the odds at all times, I put in a little box which showed the score and tapping that would
          bring up the trading form.</p>
        <div class="content-image">

        </div>
        <p>Every other piece of content was resized to make sure they best fit the smaller screen, even the logos.</p>

        <blockquote>Designing for mobile turned out to be a more complex than I had imagined, but it was worth it.
