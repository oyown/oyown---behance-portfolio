                        <p>
                        In April of 2020, James - a 3x client of mine - reached out to me to rebrand his web development agency, 17webdev. It was a massive task: he wanted a complete overhaul of the current brand, including the name. The landing page - and subsequent pages - would have to be redesigned to reflect a change in business objective: he wanted to attract funded startups instead of solopreneurs as clients and eventually, work with the best of the best.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        At the time, 17webdev did not have any clear brand identity to speak of nor did it have an in-house design team to create one. There was no cohesiveness across user touchpoints, and nothing that’d link the brand across platforms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        On top of all that, James wanted to launch something on 31st May, 2020: Memorial day in the US, 17webdev’s 3rd anniversary and just <span class="white-highlight">barely a month away.</span>
                        </p>
                      </section>

                      <div class="content-divider"></div>

                      <section class="content-width">
                        <p>I agreed, but only if I could take over the entire end-to-end design process - basically I’d be responsible for 17webdev’s entire design, from ideation to implementation to handoff. Without being in charge of everything, it would have been impossible to deliver something within a month.</p>
                        <p>James - to his credit - understood and agreed, and soon enough the rebrand was underway.</p>
                        <p>In this case study, instead of just dumping everything that I built I want to talk more about the process and the decisions that led me to ship within a month, and then keep things going on even as Covid-19 hit hard.</p>

                        <h3>The research</h3>
                        <p>Our target demographic were startups - ideally tech - in and around NYC, that were either funded or were looking for incubators. Even though the constrained timeline didn’t allow for proper user-research, it didn’t mean we could not atleast test our hypothesis.</p>
                        <p>Initial assumptions were we would be fine with a rebrand that “looked” modern and spoke to a younger demographic, however a little research quickly debunked that:</p>

                          <h5 class="white-highlight">The good</h5>
                          <li>NYC has 9000+ tech startups, with a total valuation of around $150 billion.</li>
                          <li>Edtech, Life Science and Blockchain startups made up a big chunk of that.</li>
                          <h5 class="white-highlight">The bad</h5>
                          <li>The city has 100+ startups incubators, and is one of the world’s fastest growing startup ecosystems.</li>
                          <li>According to Clutch, there are at least 2000 companies in NYC that are in the same industries as 17webdev.</li>
                          <h5 class="white-highlight">The gotcha</h5>
                          <li>The average age of a successful startup founder was 40 - 45.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Well, that and another surprising point, but more on them later ;)</p>
                        <p>The data clearly suggested we could not afford to be slacking on the brand. If we were to make something good, we’d have to offer more than whatever the 2000 other companies and incubators were offering, and we’d have to make sure people see it.</p>
                        <p>Combining both mine and James’s experience of working with several startups, we decided that the best approach would be to create a brand that was <span class="white-highlight">transparent</span>, <span class="white-highlight">approachable</span> and <span class="white-highlight">competent</span>. Enough competency and transparency would lay the groundwork for being <span class="white-highlight">reliable</span>, a key trait that should attract an experienced founder’s attention. At the other end, being approachable would give us ways to still speak to a younger demographic.</p>

                        <h3>The tough decision</h3>
                        <p>I worked with James, Juli (a brand identity designer), Chantal (a digital marketer) and Luke (developer) to ideate & create the brand. The company’s new name was OneSeven Tech, and while Juli worked on the branding, I came up with several iterations of elements that we could use across the website.</p>
                        <p>From using the New York skyline as a backdrop on the homepage to making custom icons for services, I started working on a broad range of ideas that would make the homepage stand out.</p>
                        <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>I wanted to make the experience as easy-going as possible (approachable), provide value up front (transparency) but still retain an air of “we are good at what we do” (competency). The case studies would drive the last point home.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, I settled on two distinctly different styles but with the same brand values</p>
                        <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>Incidentally, the purple & green were used for representation purposes only, but they resonated with the team. The “highlighter-stroke” effect was a runaway hit but I had to be that guy and spoil the fun. A highlighter stroke might have looked good, but it skewed towards a younger demographic rather than the middle aged we were targeting.</p>
                        <blockquote>Basic rule of UX design: just because it looks good doesn’t mean it will work.</blockquote>
                      </section>

                      <section class="content-width">
                        <h3>The “soft launch”</h3>
                        <p>At this point, we had settled on a brand identity: the colors were a shade of purple I used combined with a cream-yellow. The typography remained the same as my trial works.</p>
                        <p>Just as the brand was starting to look good, Covid-19 hit and everything was thrown to shambles.</p>
                        <p>Deadlines were extended, calls were missed and availability was a hit-or-a-miss. It was only after about 1.5 - 2 weeks we could get on a call without any issues and in a one-month period, 2 weeks of disruption was a big deal. Several back-and-forth calls quickly made it clear that it would be impossible to finish the brand within a month without compromising its quality in the process. It was an outcome nobody wanted, but nobody wanted to compromise the brand either.</p>
                        <p>Yet 31st May was too much of a perfect date to ignore.</p>
                        <p>I pitched the idea of creating a filler website: an one-page website that would showcase the services and the latest project but also make it clear that a better version was on the way.</p>
                        <p>I <span class="white-highlight">designed</span> it in Figma,</p>
                        <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">
                        <p><span class="white-highlight">developed</span> it in Webflow  (I’m an ex. Frontend Developer)</p>
                        <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>and completed it in just <span class="white-highlight">two days.</span></p>
                        <p>We had survived.</p>

                        <h3>Hitting Home</h3>
                        <p>During my research phase, I had found another good point (remember?): almost all the other web dev companies had very generic websites, like it was made for a robot that tracked numbers instead of a human who wants to be understood. I thought it was a great opportunity to set OneSeven Tech apart and showcase a brand that felt personal, human even.</p>
                        <p>How do you do that?</p>
                        <p>You might try to predict the needs of the user and assure them you already have what they need. Or you might tell them that your product works best, better than all the rest.</p>
                        <p>Both good ideas, but both overused, and frankly in my opinion, a bit presumptuous.</p>
                        <p>I decided to go a different route and try to make it like the website is talking back to you: might sound weird, but hear me out. What happens when your very first interaction with the website goes like this?
                        </p>
                        <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>While you’ve been reading that I’ve just managed to squeeze out a tiny bit more attention than the 8 seconds of your attention I’m (apparently) entitled to.</p>
                        <p>The team loved the conversational bits and I continued using them to tie sections of the webpage together, creating a flow that feels like a journey.</p>
                        <ul class="lightslider">
                          <li class="slide-item" data-thumb="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg">
                            <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">
                          </li>
                          <li class="slide-item" data-thumb="../Thumbnails/Locked - esports.jpg">

                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I also decided to remove the client names: Polarising? Yes. Good decision? Also yes. </p>
                        <p>A person looking to hire OneSeven is far more likely to identify with “AR Furniture App” or “published in Bloomberg” over the name of the client that nobody knows.</p>
                        <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>Lots of testimonials, custom icons for the process and a very intuitive contact form that feels fast topped out the experience of the home page.</p>
                        <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>12 iterations later, the homepage was done.</p>
                      </section>

                      <section class="content-width">
                        <h3>Other pages</h3>
                        <p>A homepage is only part of the story, and while that has to be the flashiest the other pages have to be functional in order to actually convert a lead.</p>
                        <p>Over the course of the project, I designed 6 other pages but instead of going through them one by one, I’m going to take you through some of the more interesting elements I decided in order to make the experience as seamless as possible.</p>

                        <h4>The contact form</h4>
                        <p>The contact form was designed to be the cornerstone of every page, so that for a person on the verge of converting, the contact form is <span class="white-highlight">always</span> either just a scroll or a click away.</p>
                        <p>I made it versatile enough to be used with just 3 fields after a case study</p>
                        <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>To expanding for the contact page</p>
                        <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>To extending it even more, with the same elements for the referral section.</p>
                        <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">
                        
                        <h4>The icons</h4>
                        <p>I think the strength of a design is judged by how fast it can attract your eye to the things that matter. In my case, icons proved to do just that.</p>
                        <p>I used them to ask users for their investment stage</p>
                        <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>to show them our services</p>
                        <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>And also to show the platforms we could build for them.</p>
                        <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">

                        <h4>The case study</h4>
                        <p>The case studies were particularly important, because they would be a big factor in showing our competency & reliability with developing projects.</p>
                        <p>I realised it was also an ideal opportunity to show our “process” more (the one I show on the homepage) - so instead of just showing everything at once, I decided to break down the case study by every step in the process. This resulted in not only a streamlined flow, but the user could actually go back and see the whole timeline of every decision taken.</p>
                        <p>Much like the one you are reading right now, seems like I really liked the idea ;)</p>
                        <img class="content-image" src="../Thumbnails/healthcare.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>There are several other less-impactful ones, such as reusing the NYC skyline for the About page, putting in clever copy like “Preferably our next client” when you click “who you are” etc. that contributed to creating the overall experience.</p>

                        <h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
                        <ul>
                          <li>A bit of (preferably early) user research can go a long way. It definitely saved us from the calamity of creating a great design for the wrong group of people - a move that probably would have shut the business down.</li>
                          <li>There are always ways to break the mold: We came up with ideas to break through in a highly lucrative market, and that was only possible because we analysed and decided to do something different against an oversaturated competition.</li>
                          <li>Knowing code doesn’t hurt. It helped me push a site within just 2 days when things became tough. While that might be a fringe case, tools like Webflow are pushing the bounds and knowing how to develop a website has never been easier. I’m an ex. Frontend dev, and even I use Webflow it’s so good.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>At the time of writing this, I have designed 7 pages (x2 because responsive) and I am just days away from pushing this into development. I design in Figma so developer handoff is always a breeze, but for now I’m still in touch with the team going over small iterations and ideations over the final design.</p>
                        <p>Please check back later for more details.</p>
