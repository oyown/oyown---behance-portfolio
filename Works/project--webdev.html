                        <p>
                        In April of 2020, James - a 3x client of mine - reached out to me to rebrand his web development agency, 17webdev. It was a massive task: he wanted a complete overhaul of the current brand, including the name. The landing page - and subsequent pages - would have to be redesigned to reflect <span class="white-highlight">a change in business objective:</span> he wanted to attract funded startups instead of solopreneurs as clients and eventually, work with the best of the best.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        At the time, 17webdev did not have any clear brand identity to speak of nor did it have an in-house design team to create one. There was no cohesiveness across user touchpoints, and nothing that’d link the brand across platforms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        On top of all that, James wanted to launch something on 31st May, 2020: Memorial day in the US, 17webdev’s 3rd anniversary and just <span class="white-highlight">barely a month away.</span>
                        </p>
                      </section>

                      <div class="content-divider"></div>

                      <section class="content-width">
                        <p>I agreed, but only if I could take over the entire end-to-end design process - basically I’d be responsible for 17webdev’s entire design, <span class="white-highlight">from ideation to implementation to handoff.</span> Without being in charge of everything, it would have been impossible to deliver something within a month.</p>
                        <p>James - to his credit - understood and agreed, and soon enough the rebrand was underway.</p>
                        <p>In this case study, instead of just dumping everything that I built I want to talk more about the process and the decisions that led me to ship within a month, and then keep things going on even as Covid-19 hit hard.</p>

                        <h3>The research</h3>
                        <p>Our target demographic were startups - ideally tech - in and around NYC, that were <span class="white-highlight">either funded or were looking for incubators.</span> Even though the constrained timeline didn’t allow for proper user-research, it didn’t mean we could not atleast test our hypothesis.</p>
                        <p>Initial assumptions were we would be fine with a rebrand that “looked” modern and spoke to a younger demographic, however a little research quickly debunked that:</p>

                          <h5 class="white-highlight">The good</h5>
                          <li>NYC has 9000+ tech startups, with a total valuation of around $150 billion.</li>
                          <li>Edtech, Life Science and Blockchain startups made up a big chunk of that.</li>
                          <h5 class="white-highlight">The bad</h5>
                          <li>The city has 100+ startups incubators, and is one of the world’s fastest growing startup ecosystems.</li>
                          <li>According to Clutch, there are at least 2000 companies in NYC that are in the same industries as 17webdev.</li>
                          <h5 class="white-highlight">The gotcha</h5>
                          <li>The average age of a successful startup founder was 40 - 45.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <!-- <p>Well, that and another surprising point, but more on them later ;)</p> -->
                        <blockquote>The data clearly suggested we could not afford to be slacking on the brand. If we were to make something good, we’d have to offer more than whatever the 2000 other companies and incubators were offering, and we’d have to make sure people see it.</blockquote>
                        <p>Combining both mine and James’s experience of working with several startups, we decided that the best approach would be to create a brand that was <span class="white-highlight">transparent</span>, <span class="white-highlight">approachable</span> and <span class="white-highlight">competent</span>. Enough competency and transparency would lay the groundwork for being <span class="white-highlight">reliable</span>, a key trait that should attract an experienced founder’s attention. At the other end, being approachable would give us ways to still speak to a younger demographic.</p>

                        <h3>The tough decision</h3>
                        <p>I worked with James, Juli (a brand identity designer), Chantal (a digital marketer) and Luke (developer) to ideate & create the brand. The company’s new name was <span class="white-highlight">OneSeven Tech</span>, and while Juli worked on the branding, I came up with several iterations of elements that we could use across the website.</p>
                        <p>From using the New York skyline as a backdrop on the homepage to making custom icons for services, I started working on a broad range of ideas that would make the homepage stand out.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>I wanted to make the experience <span class="white-highlight">reflect our brand values:</span> it'd be as easy-going as possible (approachable), provide value up front (transparency) but still retain an air of “we are good at what we do” (competency). The case studies would drive the last point home.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, I settled on two distinctly different styles.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>These concept websites for representation purposes only, but they resonated with the team. The “highlighter-stroke” effect was a runaway hit but I decided not to use it since it spoke more to the younger demographic than the older one.</p>

                        <p>At this point, we had settled on a brand identity: the colors were a shade of purple I used combined with a cream-yellow. The typography remained the same as my trial works.</p>
                        <p>Just as the brand was starting to look good, Covid-19 hit and <span class="white-highlight">everything</span> went

                        <!-- <p>Deadlines were extended, calls were missed and availability was a hit-or-a-miss. It was only after about 1.5 - 2

                        <p>Yet 31st May was too much of a perfect date to ignore.</p>
                        <p>I pitched the idea of <span class="white-highlight">creating a filler website:</span> a one-page website that would showcase the services and the latest
                          project but also make it clear that a better version was on the way.</p>

                        <p>During my research phase, I had found that almost every company had very generic websites, like it was made for a robot that tracked numbers instead of a human who wants to be understood.

                        <p>While it was tempting to put a big flashy headline, I decided to go a different route and try to make it like the website is <span class="white-highlight">talking back to you:</span>
                        </p>
                        <!-- <p>What happens when your very first interaction with the website goes like this?</p> -->

                        <p>I believe that this will intrigue users more than a bland headline, and allows me to squeeze out a tiny bit more attention than the 8 seconds I’m (apparently) entitled to.</p>
                        <p>The team loved the conversational bits and I continued using them to tie sections of the webpage together, creating <span class="white-highlight">a flow that feels like a journey.</span></p>

                          <li><span class="white-highlight">Always break the mold</span>: We came up with ideas to break through in a highly lucrative market, and that was only possible because we analysed and decided to do something different against an oversaturated competition.</li>
                          <li><span class="white-highlight">Knowing code doesn’t hurt.</span> It helped me push a site within just 2 days when things became tough. While that might be a fringe case, tools like Webflow are pushing the bounds and knowing how to develop a website has never been easier. I’m an ex. Frontend dev, and even I use Webflow it’s so good.</li>

                        <p>At the time of writing this, I have designed 7 pages (x2 because responsive) and I am just days away from pushing this into development. <span class="white-highlight">I design in Figma so developer handoff is always a breeze</span>, but for now I’m still in touch with the team going over small iterations and ideations over the final design.</p>
