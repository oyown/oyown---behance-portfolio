        <p>
          In April of 2020, James - a 3x client of mine - reached out to me to rebrand his web development agency,
          17webdev. It was a massive task: he wanted a complete overhaul of the current brand, including the name. The
          landing page - and subsequent pages - would have to be redesigned to reflect <span class="white-highlight">a
            change in business objective:</span> he wanted to attract funded startups instead of solopreneurs as clients
          and eventually, work with the best of the best.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time, 17webdev did not have any clear brand identity to speak of nor did it have an in-house design
          team to create one. There was no cohesiveness across user touchpoints, and nothing that’d link the brand
          across platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of all that, James wanted to launch something on 31st May, 2020: Memorial day in the US, 17webdev’s 3rd
          anniversary and just <span class="white-highlight">barely a month away.</span>
        </p>
      </section>

      <div class="content-divider"></div>

      <section class="content-width">
        <p>I agreed, but only if I could take over the entire end-to-end design process - basically I’d be responsible
          for 17webdev’s entire design, <span class="white-highlight">from ideation to implementation to handoff.</span>
          Without being in charge of everything, it would have been impossible to deliver something within a month.</p>
        <p>James - to his credit - understood and agreed, and soon enough the rebrand was underway.</p>
        <p>In this case study, instead of just dumping everything that I built I want to talk more about the process and
          the decisions that led me to ship within a month, and then keep things going on even as Covid-19 hit hard.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>The research</h3>
        <p>Our target demographic were startups - ideally tech - in and around NYC, that were <span
            class="white-highlight">either funded or were looking for incubators.</span> Even though the constrained
          timeline didn’t allow for proper user-research, it didn’t mean we could not atleast test our hypothesis.</p>
        <p>Initial assumptions were we would be fine with a rebrand that “looked” modern and spoke to a younger
          demographic, however a little research quickly debunked that:</p>
        <ul>
          <h5 class="white-highlight">The good</h5>
          <li>NYC has 9000+ tech startups, with a total valuation of around $150 billion.</li>
          <li>Edtech, Life Science and Blockchain startups made up a big chunk of that.</li>
          <h5 class="white-highlight">The bad</h5>
          <li>The city has 100+ startups incubators, and is one of the world’s fastest growing startup ecosystems.</li>
          <li>According to Clutch, there are at least 2000 companies in NYC that are in the same industries as 17webdev.
          </li>
          <h5 class="white-highlight">The gotcha</h5>
          <li>The average age of a successful startup founder was 40 - 45.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- <p>Well, that and another surprising point, but more on them later ;)</p> -->
        <blockquote>The data clearly suggested we could not afford to be slacking on the brand. If we were to make
          something good, we’d have to offer more than whatever the 2000 other companies and incubators were offering,
          and we’d have to make sure people see it.</blockquote>
        <p>Combining both mine and James’s experience of working with several startups, we decided that the best
          approach would be to create a brand that was <span class="white-highlight">transparent</span>, <span
            class="white-highlight">approachable</span> and <span class="white-highlight">competent</span>. Enough
          competency and transparency would lay the groundwork for being <span class="white-highlight">reliable</span>,
          a key trait that should attract an experienced founder’s attention. At the other end, being approachable would
          give us ways to still speak to a younger demographic.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>The tough decision</h3>
        <p>I worked with James, Juli (a brand identity designer), Chantal (a digital marketer) and Luke (developer) to
          ideate & create the brand. The company’s new name was <span class="white-highlight">OneSeven Tech</span>, and
          while Juli worked on the branding, I came up with several iterations of elements that we could use across the
          website.</p>
        <p>From using the New York skyline as a backdrop on the homepage to making custom icons for services, I started
          working on a broad range of ideas that would make the homepage stand out.</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Webdev/Figma Trials.jpg" alt="">
          <span class="caption">Discovery phase</caption>
        </div>
        <p>I wanted to make the experience <span class="white-highlight">reflect our brand values:</span> it'd be as
          easy-going as possible (approachable), provide value up front (transparency) but still retain an air of “we
          are good at what we do” (competency). The case studies would drive the last point home.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, I settled on two distinctly different styles.</p>
        <ul class="lightslider">
          <li class="slide-item" data-thumb="../Works/Images/Webdev/Trial 1.jpg">
            <div class="content-image">
              <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Webdev/Trial 1.jpg" alt="">
              <span class="caption">The neon-green "Highlighter Stroke"</caption>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="slide-item" data-thumb="../Works/Images/Webdev/Trial 2.jpg">
            <div class="content-image">
              <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Webdev/Trial 2.jpg" alt="">
              <span class="caption">More subdued & modern purple</caption>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These concept websites for representation purposes only, but they resonated with the team. The
          “highlighter-stroke” effect was a runaway hit but I decided not to use it since it spoke more to the younger
          demographic than the older one.</p>
        <!-- <blockquote>Basic rule of UX design: just because it looks good doesn’t mean it will work.</blockquote> -->
      </section>

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>The “soft launch”</h3>
        <p>At this point, we had settled on a brand identity: the colors were a shade of purple I used combined with a
          cream-yellow. The typography remained the same as my trial works.</p>
        <p>Just as the brand was starting to look good, Covid-19 hit and <span class="white-highlight">everything</span>
          went
          downhill.</p>
        <!-- <p>Deadlines were extended, calls were missed and availability was a hit-or-a-miss. It was only after about 1.5 - 2
          weeks we could get on a call without any issues and in a one-month period, 2 weeks of disruption was a big deal.</p> -->

        <blockquote>Several back-and-forth calls quickly made it clear that it would be impossible to finish the brand
          within a month, without compromising its quality in the process. It was an outcome nobody wanted, but nobody
          wanted to compromise the brand either.</blockquote>
        <p>Yet 31st May was too much of a perfect date to ignore.</p>
        <p>I pitched the idea of <span class="white-highlight">creating a filler website:</span> a one-page website that
          would showcase the services and the latest
          project but also make it clear that a better version was on the way.</p>
        <p>I designed it in Figma,</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Webdev/Filler.jpg" alt="">
          <span class="caption">Figma design</caption>
        </div>
        <p><span class="white-highlight">developed</span> it in Webflow (I’m an ex. Frontend Developer)</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Webdev/Webflow Filler.png" alt="">
          <span class="caption">Webflow - almost 100% resemblance.</caption>
        </div>
        <p>and completed it in just <span class="white-highlight">two days.</span></p>
        <p>We had survived.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>Hitting Home</h3>
        <p>During my research phase, I had found that almost every company had very generic websites, like it was made
          for a robot that tracked numbers instead of a human who wants to be understood. I thought it was a great
          opportunity to set OneSeven Tech apart and showcase a brand that felt personal, human even.</p>
        <!-- <p>How do you do that?</p>
        <p>You might try to predict the needs of the user and assure them you already have what they need. Or you might tell them that your product works best, better than all the rest.</p> -->
        <p>While it was tempting to put a big flashy headline, I decided to go a different route and try to make it like
          the website is <span class="white-highlight">talking back to you:</span>
        </p>
        <!-- <p>What happens when your very first interaction with the website goes like this?</p> -->
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Webdev/First Conversation.jpg" alt="">
          <span class="caption">Conversation starter.</caption>
        </div>
        <p>I believe that this will intrigue users more than a bland headline, and allows me to squeeze out a tiny bit
          more attention than the 8 seconds I’m (apparently) entitled to.</p>
        <p>The team loved the conversational bits and I continued using them to tie sections of the webpage together,
          creating <span class="white-highlight">a flow that feels like a journey.</span></p>
        <ul class="lightslider">
          <li class="slide-item" data-thumb="../Works/Images/Webdev/Second Conversation.jpg">
            <div class="content-image">

            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also decided to <span class="white-highlight">remove client names and logos:</span> Polarising? Yes. Good
          decision? Also yes. </p>
        <p>A person looking to hire OneSeven is far more likely to identify with “AR Furniture App” or “published in
          Bloomberg” over the name of the client that nobody knows.</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Webdev/Project.jpg" alt="">
          <span class="caption">Way more intuitive.</caption>
        </div>
        <p>Lots of testimonials, custom icons for the process and a very intuitive contact form that feels fast topped
          out the experience of the home page.</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Webdev/Publication.jpg" alt="">
          <span class="caption">Publications and Our Process.</caption>
        </div>
        <p>12 iterations later, the homepage was done.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>Backup</h3>
        <p>A homepage, while the flashiest, is only part of the story. The other pages have to be just as good.</p>
        <p>Over the course of the project, I designed 6 other pages but instead of going through them one by one, I’m
          going to take you through some of the more interesting elements I created <span class="white-highlight">to tie
            all those pages together.</span></p>

        <h4>The contact form</h4>
        <p>The contact form was designed to be the cornerstone of every page, so that for a person on the verge of
          converting, the contact form is <span class="white-highlight">always</span> either just a scroll or a click
          away.</p>
        <!-- <p>I made it versatile enough to be used with just 3 fields after a case study</p> -->
        <ul class="lightslider">
          <li class="slide-item" data-thumb="../Works/Images/Webdev/Contact - 1.jpg">
            <div class="content-image">

            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <h4>The icons</h4>
        <p>I think the strength of a design is judged by how fast it can attract your eye to the things that matter. In
          my case, icons proved to do just that.</p>

        <h4>The case study</h4>
        <p>The case studies were a big factor in showing our competency & reliability.</p>
        <p>I realised it was also an ideal opportunity to expand on "Our Process" - so rather than just dumping
          everything we had to say, I decided to weave a story where <span class="white-highlight">every step was a step
            in "Our Process".</span></p>
        <!-- <p>Much like the one you are reading right now, seems like I really liked the idea ;)</p> -->

        <p>There are several other less-impactful ones, such as reusing the NYC skyline for the About page, putting in
          clever copy like “Preferably our next client” when you click “who you are” etc. that contributed to the
          overall experience.</p>

        <h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="white-highlight">A bit of (preferably early) user research can go a long way.</span> It
            definitely saved us from the calamity of creating a great design for the wrong group of people - a move that
            probably would have shut the business down.</li>
          <li><span class="white-highlight">Always break the mold</span>: We came up with ideas to break through in a
            highly lucrative market, and that was only possible because we analysed and decided to do something
            different against an oversaturated competition.</li>
          <li><span class="white-highlight">Knowing code doesn’t hurt.</span> It helped me push a site within just 2
            days when things became tough. While that might be a fringe case, tools like Webflow are pushing the bounds
            and knowing how to develop a website has never been easier. I’m an ex. Frontend dev, and even I use Webflow
            it’s so good.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the time of writing this, I have designed 7 pages (x2 because responsive) and I am just days away from
          pushing this into development. <span class="white-highlight">I design in Figma so developer handoff is always
            a breeze</span>, but for now I’m still in touch with the team going over small iterations and ideations over
          the final design.</p>
        <p>Please check back later for more details.</p>
