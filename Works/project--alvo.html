          Alvo required an interface that worked seamlessly in VR and appealed to the already massive user base of first
          person shooters. An identity was built comprising of familiar elements from the web & traditional games while
          still taking advantage of the infinite expanse of VR.

        <p>I agreed, but only if I could take over the entire end-to-end design process - basically I’d be responsible
          for 17webdev’s entire design, <span class="white-highlight">from ideation to implementation to handoff.</span>
          Without being in charge of everything, it would have been impossible to deliver something within a month.</p>
        <p>James - to his credit - understood and agreed, and soon enough the rebrand was underway.</p>
        <p>In this case study, instead of just dumping everything that I built I want to talk more about the process and
          the decisions that led me to ship within a month, and then keep things going on even as Covid-19 hit hard.</p>
      </section> -->

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>Limited by skillset, not by bezels - Research section</h3>
        <p>With it's first game in VR, Alvo was looking to enter a market still not dominated by the big names. Present
          games in VR consisted of mosty battle-royale style gameplay with graphics that looked like it was out of the
          90s. While VR is a challenging area to work for, Alvo still wanted to push the edge and give a present day
          game feel in your head.</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Webdev/Figma Trials.jpg" alt="">
          <span class="caption">New Territory</caption>
        </div>
        <p>To take full advantage of the wider field of view in VR, it was important to have an idea where on the plane
          it was easiest for the player to interact.</p>
        <p>It also came into light that even though players have the freedom to turn anywhere they want to, they almost
          always will be going facing forward instead of backward.</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Webdev/Figma Trials.jpg" alt="">
          <span class="caption">That turns heads.</caption>
        </div>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, VR field of view mimicks real life - player focus remains at the center of the field of view
          thus allowing anything to be placed within a comfortable viewing area.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>Overall Interface</h3>
        <p>The interface was kept minimal down to the very core, only attracting the attention of the player when
          necessary and taking care to stay out of the way of the gameplay experience.</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Webdev/Filler.jpg" alt="">
          <span class="caption">[ insert card images on the right / weapon carousel so it links to info box? ]</caption>
        </div>
        <p>However, considering that many players would be newcomers to the genre, several tips were used to guide them
          throughout.</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Webdev/Filler.jpg" alt="">
          <span class="caption">[insert info box image]</caption>
        </div>

        <h4>Turning heads, literally.</h4>
        <p>Taking advantage of VR over static screens was crucial to the gameplay experience - hence, players are
          prompted to turn heads to access in-game elements such as leaderboards, stats etc. </p>
        <p>However, care was taken so that everything crucial to their success showed up front and center.</p>
        <p>Players are also encouraged to turn their heads around - creating a surreal experience that is not often seen
          in traditional gameplay.</p>

        </div>

        <h4>Spoilt for choice.</h4>
        <p>Even though this is a new medium, gamers shouldn't have to learn a new way of navigating it.</p>
        <p>Taking a cue from existing games and web UI, illustrations & iconography have been used in various places -
          from showcasing different levels and modes of the game to assisting gamers with navigation menus.</p>
        <p>Lastly, true to the value of doing something different, 3d imagery was used for close-ups within a non-gaming
          environment.</p>

        <p>Alvo wouldn't be Alvo if they didn't reward them for it.</p>
        <p>With help from thenounproject, military icons were rewared to players in recognition for their skill levels
          in the game - it's a mark that other players see in-game and in leaderboards.</p>

        <p>Games are fun, and players love to showcase individuality while having fun. Alvo didn't want them to miss out
          on that.</p>
        <p>Several random pattern & color masks were created to give the players a choice in how they are viewed by
          their teammates, and how they show up in leaderboards.</p>

        <h3>Something about the marketplace</h3>
        <p>Alvo is all about clarity yet have the audacity to stand out from others.</p>
        <p>It needed a wordmark that reflected all that, and yet was simple enough to stand out on a crowded online
          marketplace.</p>
        <p>A sans-serif military style typeface mixed with a grunge pattern was just the right mixture, providing the
          perfect combination of clarity and ruggedness that is often associated with FPS games.</p>

        <h3>Caring for the gamer.</h3>
        <p>VR headsets have been said to create a feeling of nausea in certain cases - care has been taken not to
          include any flashing graphics or distracting animations that might accelerate the feeling.</p>
        <p>Addtionally, rounds have been kept at a max limit of 10 mins and a virtual warning has been included if the
          player is using the headset for a long time.

        <h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="white-highlight">A bit of (preferably early) user research can go a long way.</span> It
            definitely saved us from the calamity of creating a great design for the wrong group of people - a move that
            probably would have shut the business down.</li>
          <li><span class="white-highlight">Always break the mold</span>: We came up with ideas to break through in a
            highly lucrative market, and that was only possible because we analysed and decided to do something
            different against an oversaturated competition.</li>
          <li><span class="white-highlight">Knowing code doesn’t hurt.</span> It helped me push a site within just 2
            days when things became tough. While that might be a fringe case, tools like Webflow are pushing the bounds
            and knowing how to develop a website has never been easier. I’m an ex. Frontend dev, and even I use Webflow
            it’s so good.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the time of writing this, I have designed 7 pages (x2 because responsive) and I am just days away from
          pushing this into development. <span class="white-highlight">I design in Figma so developer handoff is always
            a breeze</span>, but for now I’m still in touch with the team going over small iterations and ideations over
          the final design.</p>
